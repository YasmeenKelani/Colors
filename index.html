      How to Decide What Paint to Use? people often ask: What’s the “best” or “most popular” type of paint to use? This is a question that virtually has no definitive answer. Not what you wanted to hear? Don’t worry; we’re here to give you some pointers! The fact is that the “best” paint to use depends on the skill and patience of the painter, and also the type of “look” desired. Different paints will give a different type of character to the subject of the painting, and evoke different types of emotions from an audience. For example, watercolor often lends to a more muted, somewhat clouded image. While colorful, it also has a more softened look. The subject can look runny or malleable. Oil paint is very rich and vibrant. Oil paintings usually have a sharper image, but it’s also good for colorful pieces that feature a layering of paint. Acrylic is generally always going to give you something in between. Depending on the technique used by the artist,  artist acrylic paints can look very much like oil or watercolor, and the meshing of the two lends to a style that is uniquely its own. These are generalities; of course, the result depends on the technique and style of the artist. Aside from the more abstract features of the products, there are fundamental differences between watercolor, oil, and acrylic paint that should be taken into consideration before choosing which medium is best for you.</li></p>
